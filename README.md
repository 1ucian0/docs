# Welcome

Fuzzbuzz is a platform that allows you to automatically test your code for critical bugs and vulnerabilities, by running millions of intelligently generated tests per day using a technique called Fuzzing. Fuzzbuzz continuously runs tests whenever your source code is updated, and after initial setup, requires no further attention until it alerts you that it's found a bug.
