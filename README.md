# Welcome

Fuzzbuzz is a platform that allows you to automatically test your code for critical bugs and vulnerabilities, by running millions of intelligently generated tests per day using a technique called Fuzzing. Fuzzbuzz continuously runs tests whenever your source code is updated, and after initial setup, requires no further attention until it alerts you that it's found a bug.

For an introduction to using Fuzzbuzz, check out our Getting Started section:

To learn more about fuzzing, and about how Fuzzbuzz makes it really simple, check out our Fuzzing 101 article, followed by our platform overview:
